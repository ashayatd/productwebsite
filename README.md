# productwebsite_____Game Development Courses
Game Development coure is a website to sell online courses of game development graphics development like stuffs. I have been through huge amount of research on online courses before making this website.
Place where I got stuck:
        a. Researching about online courses companies selling: there are tremendous amount of courses available online but to choose them and shortlist them to put on to            my website was the biggest challenge which I overcome it by searching lot over the internet. 
        b. The layout of the website was quite difficult to think. As it was clearly mention from Newton's side that we have to work on the given criterias. making those            points into the criteria and building a website was a difficult part.
        c. UI/UX part:  There are enormous number of fonts available on the internet making a choice to put a single font over the entire website was a bit challenging              thing. Along with this keeping the UI and UX thing in mind I had to create a website which looks good and provide all the important features like hover and              all.
        d. Making the structure: literally got stuck into making the structure inside a division which gives equal weight to all the entities present in the same. my                mentor Mr. Somendra s. help me out with the concept of flex. Which is I think the foundation element of a website.
        e. At the end I got stuck on the deployment face where my mentor mr. Somendra s along with my peer Mr.Tejas B. help me out with the entire process from uploading            to the get her and opening it into the browser through URL.
        
Overall the experience was great Learnt great concepts along with implementation of them.
